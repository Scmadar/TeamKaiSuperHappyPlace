This is a Rock Paper Scissors java game designed by Team Kai of CS151. If you don't know what that is, you probably shouldn't be here.

That being said, feel free to look around and stuff, not too worried about anything getting stolen. If you have any suggestions feel free to (I don't know if there's a messaging system in this, but if there is use that) any of us collaborators.
